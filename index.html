       Welcome to my website! I work in Open science and scholarly communication, and I have a PhD in computer music.
    </p>

    <h2>Open Science</h2>
    <p>
      I work in this field since 2015. I started at Université Paris-Est and currently (2021) at Université Paris Cité (<a href="https://ror.org/05f82e368" target="_blank"> ror.org/05f82e368</a>). My work is to developp open science within the university. I am the project manager of a new publishing platform. In open science I am interested in policies, technology, research evaluation, and the ecosystem of scientific knowledge : publications, data and software.

    <h2>Computer Music </h2>
    <p>
      My research focuses on computer music, <i>i.e.</i> the music that is written with programming languages. This music involves a particular medium, a digital one, which appears to the musicologist as a bundle of lines of code. The starting point of my research work proceeds from the interactions between the medium and the musicologist, in another word how to get the knowledge in the medium to conduct a musical analysis. Jean-Claude Risset is a prominent figure in my work. Using the term 'exhaustive score', he emphasizes the richness of digital medium in musical analysis. Nevertheless, he stated in 2000s that musicology was not yet prepared to investigate this medium. My research aims to highlight this mediums so they can be used for analyses purposes.
      

      <!--My PhD, completed in January 2018, is made up three parts. The first one focuses on the specifities of the musical digital support ; the second part defines the musicologist conceptual tools, and the last part deals with their practical application, analysing <i>Jupiter</i> (1987) by Philippe Manoury, for flute and live electronics, composed at Ircam (Paris).
             
      For example, a key researcher in our reflection is Jean-Claude Risset. In the 2000s he had shown that the digital support is such a richness for the musical analysis -- he spoke of 'exhastivs score'. But in the same way, he has shown that musicology is not yet prepared to enlight these digital medium. My research aim to bring some light inside these mediums, so that we can use it in analysis purpose.
      My PhD, completed in january of 2018, is made of three parts. The first one focus on the specifities of the musical digital support ; the second part explained some conceptual tools for the musicologist, and the last part is an application of latter's concepts, where I analyzed <i>Jupiter</i> (1987) by Philippe Manoury, for flute and live electronics, composed at Ircam (Paris). -->
